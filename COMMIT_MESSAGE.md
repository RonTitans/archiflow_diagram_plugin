feat: Add NetBox real-time integration and fix critical bugs

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Database schema updated with NetBox cache tables
- New sync endpoint required for NetBox integration

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: Devices disappear after switching diagrams
- Added auto-save before deployment in frontend/app.js
- Ensures device data is persisted to database before deploying to NetBox
- Prevents data loss when navigating between diagrams

### Bug #2: Duplicate device names
- Implemented backend API to check existing device names
- Added `getNextDeviceCounter()` in network-device-manager.js
- Frontend plugin now queries backend before auto-naming devices
- Checks both NetBox and local database for name collisions

### Bug #3: Allocated IPs show as available
- Modified `getPoolIPAddresses()` to query NetBox IP cache
- Real-time IP allocation status from NetBox
- Allocated IPs now correctly marked as unavailable

### Bug #4: Deployment status not displaying
- Fixed column name mismatch (status vs deployment_status)
- Updated deployment-service.js to use correct column
- Diagram list now correctly shows "Deployed" status

## New Features

### NetBox Real-Time Integration
- Added device sync from NetBox (`syncDevices()`)
- Added IP address sync from NetBox (`syncIPAddresses()`)
- Created NetBox cache tables for devices and IPs
- Device name uniqueness now validates against NetBox
- IP allocation status reflects NetBox state

### Database Enhancements
- New table: `netbox_devices` - Cache existing devices for name checking
- New table: `netbox_ip_addresses` - Cache IP allocations
- Added stored function: `get_next_device_counter()`
- All tables automatically created on fresh deployment

### API Enhancements
- New WebSocket action: `get_next_device_counter`
- Enhanced sync service to include devices and IPs
- Backend returns device counter based on NetBox + local data

## Files Modified

### Backend
- backend/network-device-manager.js
  - Added `getNextDeviceCounter()` method (lines 764-818)
  - Fixed `getPoolIPAddresses()` to use NetBox cache (lines 595-610)
  - Added logging for IP pools and VLANs

- backend/websocket-server.js
  - Added `handleGetNextDeviceCounter()` handler (lines 1231-1263)
  - Added route for `get_next_device_counter` action

- backend/netbox/sync-service.js
  - Added `syncDevices()` method (lines 428-504)
  - Added `syncIPAddresses()` method (lines 506-568)
  - Updated `syncAll()` to include new syncs

- backend/netbox/client.js
  - Added `getDevices()` method
  - Added `getDevicesByPattern()` method for name matching

- backend/netbox/deployment-service.js
  - Fixed `updateDiagramStatus()` to use `deployment_status` column
  - Fixed column creation method

### Frontend
- frontend/app.js
  - Added auto-save before deployment (lines 905-917)
  - Added handler for device counter request (lines 258-271)
  - Added WebSocket response forwarding to plugin (lines 446-456)

- frontend/archiflow-network-plugin.js
  - Made `generateDeviceName()` async (lines 31-110)
  - Added backend API call for device counter
  - Implemented timeout and fallback mechanisms
  - Made `showDeviceConfigDialog()` async

### Database
- database/netbox-devices-ips-cache.sql (NEW)
  - Creates `netbox_devices` table
  - Creates `netbox_ip_addresses` table
  - Adds indexes for performance
  - Includes stored function for counter logic

- database/init-complete.sql
  - Ensured `deployment_status` column exists
  - Added proper indexes

### Docker
- docker/docker-compose.yml
  - Added netbox-cache-schema.sql to init scripts
  - Added netbox-devices-ips-cache.sql to init scripts
  - Ensures all migrations run on first start

### Documentation
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (NEW)
  - Comprehensive deployment instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Demo flow for presentations
  - Pre-deployment checklist

## Testing Performed

✅ Fresh deployment from scratch
✅ Database migrations run automatically
✅ NetBox sync completes successfully
✅ Device name uniqueness validation
✅ IP allocation status accuracy
✅ Diagram save before deployment
✅ Deployment status display
✅ Switch between diagrams without data loss

## Deployment Instructions

1. Pull latest changes
2. Run: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Run: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/api/netbox/sync`
4. System is ready!

All database migrations run automatically on container startup.

## Breaking Changes

If upgrading from previous version:
1. Stop containers: `docker-compose down`
2. Backup database (optional): `docker exec archiflow-postgres pg_dump -U archiflow_user archiflow > backup.sql`
3. Remove volumes (if needed): `docker-compose down -v`
4. Pull new code
5. Start: `docker-compose up -d`
6. Sync NetBox: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/api/netbox/sync`

## Notes for Tomorrow's Presentation

- All services start automatically with `docker-compose up -d`
- NetBox sync should be run once after startup
- Device naming will be unique (checked against NetBox)
- IP pools and VLANs will load correctly
- Deployment to NetBox works end-to-end
- System is production-ready
